## About Banchan Art
Built by the Digital Workers Guild, LLC., Banchan Art is a website focused on providing a user-friendly space for artists for managing their clients, commissions, and invoices.

### Behind the Name
Banchan Art is named for the Korean culinary tradition of shared side dishes. 

Banchan includes a variety of dishes with different flavors and meanings. Each meal is a unique experience due to the constantly rotating selection of dishes and your ability to cater your meal by how much of each dish you select for yourself. You are able to satiate your palate for different tastes as you please. 

The idea behind Banchan Art is to build a platform that provides a meeting point for artists and their supporters. This is a place where both artists and their patrons can customize their experience in a mutually beneficial and harmonious way. Our ideal for the platform is to make it easy and enjoyable to commission a custom piece of art for both sides. Similar to choosing different amounts of banchan to cater a meal to your taste, supporters can choose from different options set up by artists to commission the art piece that they will treasure.

# About Banchan Art

Banchan Art is a website focused on providing a user-friendly space for
artists for managing their clients, commissions, and invoices, and for patrons
to discover artists to commission art from.

It's created, owned, and maintained with love and solidarity by the [Banchan Art LLC](https://banchan.art), a worker- and artist-owned organization.

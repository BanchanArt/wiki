# About Banchan Art

Banchan Art is a website focused on providing a user-friendly space for
artists for managing their clients, commissions, and invoices, and for patrons
to discover artists to commission art from.

It's created, owned, and maintained with love and solidarity by the [Digital
Workers Guild](https://www.dwg.dev/) ("DWG"), a worker co-operative making
stuff for communities that need them.

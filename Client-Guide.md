# Client Guide

Everyone who registers for an account on our platform has the ability to submit proposals for commissions.

## Step 2: Verify Account

Check your inbox for an email titled "Confirm Your Banchan Art Email" from the banchan.art domain. Click on the confirm link in that email to verify your account.

## Step 3: Find and follow artists

# Studio Guide

1. Go to <https://banchan.art/beta> and sign up, if you haven't already.
2. Wait for an invite email. These are sent as invites become available during our beta.
3. Once you receive your email, you can click the link to grant you artist privileges on the site. This link can only be used once.
4. Back on the website, you should now see a new area on the left-side navigation, with an option to create a new studio:

5. Clicking on New Studio will take you to the Studio Creation page, where you can configure your Studio details. Mature configures whether all your offerings will be NSFW/mature. If only some of them will be, you don't need to check this. Country should be your country of residence and/or where you have an active bank account. This is where your Stripe account will be created. Default currency and Currencies configure what currencies your offerings will be able to use as their presentation currencies. That is, what it looks like on the site. You will still be able to accept payment from any of the 140+ supported currencies even if you don't configure them here.
6. After this studio is created, you still have some configuration to do before your studio is fully ready: go to your Studio page, which should be available through the top-left nav now, and go to Edit Profile.
7. In this page, you should configure the remaining fields: Card Image, Gallery Images, and About are the most important ones. Filling these out is required before your studios and offerings will show up on the Home and Discover pages.
